# ChatServer-SSL-vs-no-SSL
A side-by-side comparison of a multithreaded chat server with and without SSL. This is not a project, it's here to illustrate a bug.

The version with no SSL is an EXACT copy of a chat server done by user fliedonion found here:
https://gist.github.com/fliedonion/1002293af6fd043fbd6e729c13018562

The master branch has the upgraded SSL version of the chat server done by fliedonion from the link above, the "without-SSL" branch has the original version of that code with the filenames renamed for comparison purposes. Please note that you must rename those .java files to their original class names before running them (just remove the "-w-SSL" at the ends of each one).
